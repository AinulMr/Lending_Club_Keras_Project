# Lending_Club_Keras_Project
With historical data on loans and information on whether a borrower defaulted (charge-off) or not, can we build a model that can predict whether a borrower will repay their loan? Thus, in the future when a new prospective customer comes along, we can assess whether they are likely to repay their loan.
